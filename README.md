## softstats
<tt>softstats</tt> is collection of statistical tools and utility routines used to analyze the multi-scale structure of 2D and 3D spatial fields and particle distributions.

Routines are designed to work with large datasets and some include optional CuPy acceleration. Each routine aims to be independent from the rest of the package, so users may pick out the parts that they need.
