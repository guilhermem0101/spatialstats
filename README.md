# softstats
<tt>softstats</tt> is collection of statistical tools and utility routines used to analyze multi-scale soft and biological matter systems. It is designed to work with very large datasets with optional CUDA acceleration.

It also aims to be very modular if people wish to use a routine from <tt>softstats</tt> without using the whole package. Individual routines can be plucked out of the package and used alone.
